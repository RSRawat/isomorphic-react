# ReactJs isomorphic application
Created isomorphic application using react, node and express js, for learning purpose.

## How to install
* Clone this repository in your machine
* Open command prompt navigate to folder location
* Run command `npm i`
* Once finished, run command `npm run dev`
* Launch browser and open http://localhost:3000

## Things I learned
* Use React *hydrate* method instead of *render*
* Use static router server side and browser router at client side
* Use *renderToString* for sending final HTML generated on server to client
* Instead of using *Route* from *react-router-dom*, create a cofiguration file and pass it to *renderRoutes* method from *react-router-config*
* **npm-run-all** lets you run multiple npm scripts at once
* Use *react-helmet* for dynamically inserting meta tags
